# My-First-Structorizer-Flowcharts

This repository contains some of my very first flowcharts created with [Structorizer](https://structorizer.fisch.lu/), a tool used to design and visualize algorithms using Nassi-Shneiderman Diagrams (NSD).

These projects were made as part of my early programming and algorithm exercises. They are very simple and mainly focused on learning how to represent basic logic, conditions, and sequences in a visual format.

## Files

- `oefening1evaluatie.nsd`: A small flowchart exercise. Likely includes basic input/output and a simple if-statement.
- `oef2evaluatie.nsd`: Another basic exercise, probably continuing with slightly more logic or structure.

## What is Structorizer?

Structorizer is a tool for drawing Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams, often used in programming education. It helps visualize structured programming logic, especially helpful for beginners.

## Why this repo?

I'm learning how to design and understand algorithms. These files show my first steps in thinking like a programmer. I'm still at the beginning of my journey and sharing these here helps me stay motivated and track my progress.

## Notes

- These are beginner-level exercises, mostly made for practice.
- Diagrams can be opened with the Structorizer application.
